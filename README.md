## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person
- **Bonus 1**: Save the game state in the browser so that it’s preserved if the player refreshes their browser
- **Bonus 2**: Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so it’s proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- SASS

### What I learned

I learned a lot about using React in this project. Before this, I had used React to build a simple hangman game and a pomodoro clock. I feel like after completing this project, I'm finally starting to get the hang of React.

Also, this was the first time I really developed a project using Git. Before I had simply uploaded my code to GitHub when I was finished, but this time around I linked to the repository from the start and made incremental commits. I found it very nice, as a couple times I decided my progress wasn't going anywhere, and it was easy to revert back to a previous state.

### Continued development

I want to go deeper into learning React and also learn more about backend development.

### Useful resources
